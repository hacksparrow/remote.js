Remote.js
=========

Remote.js is a library for developing remote controlled web apps. It is wireless and does not require additional hardware - it works via audio frequencies.

## Quick demo

**Note**: Apps were tested on Google Chrome only. If the examples don't work, try restarting the browser.

* [Open the remote controller app on your smartphone](https://hacksparrow.github.io/remote.js/example/controller.html)
* [Open the demo app on your desktop / laptop](https://hacksparrow.github.io/remote.js/example/controlled.html)

Once the apps are loaded, point the remote at the demo, and press the buttons.

## How to use

To develop a remote controlled web app using Remote.js, you will need to create a **transmitter** (remote controller) and a **receiver** (the web app). The  app listens for 'signals' from the transmitter and executes JavaScript code programmed by you, when it receives them.

### Creating a transmitter

Include [remote.transmitter.js](https://raw2.github.com/hacksparrow/remote.js/master/dist/remote.transmitter.js) in the transmitter app's HTML page. Once included, you can create a transmitter as shown in this example.

    var signals = ['cat', 'HIDE CONTENT', 'github'];
    var t = Remote.transmitter(signals);

    // ideally, signals would be emitted when buttons are clicked
    document.querySelector('#cat-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
      t.emit('cat');
    });

    document.querySelector('#github-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
      t.emit('github');
    });

    // signals can be emitted any way you like, though
    setTimeout(function() {
      t.emit('foo');
    }, 5000);

**NOTE**

1. Signal names can be anything of your choice.
2. The signal array MUST be the same for both the transmitter and the receiver.
3. Currently, a max of 13 signals are supported.

### Creating a receiver

Include [remote.receiver.js](https://raw2.github.com/hacksparrow/remote.js/master/dist/remote.receiver.js) in the receiver app's HTML page. Once included, you can create a receiver as shown in this example.

    var signals = ['cat', 'HIDE CONTENT', 'foo'];
    var r = Remote.receiver(signals);

    r.on('cat', function(error, signal) {
      if (!error) alert('Cats are mini-Tigers!');
    });

    r.on('HIDE CONTENT', function(error, signal) {
       document.querySelector('#content').style.display = 'none';
    });

    r.on('github', function(error, signal) {
      window.open('https://github.com');
    });

What the signal can do is entirely upto you, the developer. Anything you can do with JavaScript, a valid signal can trigger it. Let your imaginations run wild!

## Possible uses

1. Media controls
2. Games - remote controlled, multi-player
3. Slideshows
4. Pranks
5. Malware
6. Interesting browser extensions

## Todo

1. Increase the number of supported signals
2. Cross-browser fixes

## Background

I set out to create a wireless data transfer medium using acoustic frequencies, but faced some challenges because of which I paused worked on it, and instead created Remote.js out of the work done so far.

The following are some interesting points from my experiment.

Equipment used: Web Audio API, Nexus 5 (transmitter), MacBook Pro (receiver).

1. The mic is very bad at 'listening to' some random frequencies (even loud audible frequencies). This may be resonance and / or interference from the computer parts.
2. As the frequency crosses 15khz, the amplitude decreases in a proportionate manner - the range decreases as a result.
3. Frequency bleeding and interference is rampant. This can be avoided by keeping a significant gap between the bit-frequencies. Because of problem no. 2, using higher frequencies is almost impossible.
4. Surprisingly, interference from a normal work / home background environment is very rare.
5. The bitrate has to be very low. If you try to increase it, you lose accuracy in frequency detection.
6. I used ASCII 'symbols' for higher bandwidth. Using binary 'symbols' binary files can be transferred more reliably, but the bandwidth would be waaay lower.
